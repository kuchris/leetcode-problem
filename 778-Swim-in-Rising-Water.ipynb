    "# --- Dijkstra's Algorithm Explained ---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's Algorithm is a **greedy algorithm** that finds the **shortest path** between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept:\n",
    "- **Goal**: Find the path with minimum total distance/weight from start to destination\n",
    "- **Approach**: Always explore the node with the smallest current distance first\n",
    "- **Data Structure**: Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** to efficiently get the next best node\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** all distances to infinity except start node (distance = 0)\n",
    "2. **Create min-heap** with (distance, node) pairs, starting with (0, start_node)\n",
    "3. **Maintain visited set** to avoid reprocessing nodes\n",
    "4. **Loop until heap is empty**:\n",
    "   - Extract node with minimum distance\n",
    "   - Update distances for all unvisited neighbors\n",
    "   - Add neighbors to heap if shorter path found\n",
    "5. **Terminate** when destination reached\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Swim in Rising Water:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dijkstra's mapping to this problem:\n",
    "# - \"Distance\" = Maximum elevation encountered so far\n",
    "# - \"Node\" = Grid cell position (x, y)\n",
    "# - \"Weight\" = Cell elevation value\n",
    "# - \"Shortest path\" = Path with minimum maximum elevation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Perfect for This Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bottleneck Optimization**: We need to minimize the maximum elevation (water level)\n",
    "2. **Greedy Choice**: Always exploring lower elevations first ensures optimal path\n",
    "3. **Shortest Path Analogy**: \"Shortest\" = \"lowest water level needed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Properties:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V) where E = edges, V = vertices\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for visited set and heap\n",
    "- **Guarantees**: Finds optimal solution for non-negative weights\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Doesn't work with negative edge weights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm in This Problem:\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Grid cells (i, j)\n",
    "- **Edges**: 4-directional adjacency\n",
    "- **Edge Weight**: Maximum of current elevation and neighbor elevation\n",
    "- **Goal**: Minimize the maximum elevation encountered from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is perfect for problems where you need to find a path that minimizes some \"cost\" metric - in this case, the water level needed to swim!"
