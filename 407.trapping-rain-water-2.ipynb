    "- Put ALL 14 boundary cells in a min-heap (sorted by height)\n",
    "- Mark them as visited\n",
    "- These are our \"walls\" - water can escape through them\n",

    "**Step 2: Process Lowest Boundary First**\n",
    "- Pop the cell with **minimum height** from heap\n",
    "- This is the weakest point where water can escape\n",
    "- Update `max_height` (our water level)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Explore Neighbors**\n",
    "- Look at the 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "- If neighbor is **unvisited**:\n",
    "  - If `neighbor_height < max_height` → **WATER TRAPPED!** 💧\n",
    "  - Water amount = `max_height - neighbor_height`\n",
    "  - Add neighbor to heap (it's now a new boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Repeat**\n",
    "- Keep processing until all cells are visited\n",
    "- We gradually move from outside to inside, finding all trapped water\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Concept:\n",
